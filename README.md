# moderation-bot

This is a discord moderation-bot developed by me using discord.py while participating in Bot-A-Thon, INNERVE-2021. The bot can be used to ban, kick, mute members and clear messages. It is using a JSON as database for storing blacklisted words. The prefix for the bot is "!". You may use !h or !help to know more about the features of the bot.
